# How to design a SWAMP workflow

A workflow is a sequence of tasks needed to achieve a desired result.

SWAMP's strength lie in two aspects of managing a workflow:

- collecting necessary data
- reminding people that they have to do something, and keep track who did what at which point in time

To design a workflow, you need the following information:

- description of the desired result
- what information (data) is needed as input, or will be produced alongside the result
- what steps need to be done, in which order, maybe in parallel?
- who will perform these steps

Design the 'data model' and the 'flow chart' of a workflow separately. In SWAMP, you have access to all data fields at any point in the workflow (they may be empty of course).
